#### 📍 Exercise 1:


In a music group there are different types of musical instruments. There are wind, string and percussion instruments.

All instruments have their name, and their price as attributes. In addition, they have a method called touch(). 

This is abstract in the instrument class and must therefore be implemented in the daughter classes. If a wind instrument is playing, the method must show by console: "It's playing a wind instrument," if you're playing a string instrument: “It’s playing a string instrument” and if you’re playing a percussion instrument: "It's playing a percussion instrument."

The process of loading a class takes place only once. Demonstrates that the load can be caused by the creation of the first instance of this class or by access to a static member of it.
