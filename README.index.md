## IT ACADEMY - JAVA & SPRING FRAMEWORK: MY WORK AS STUDENT

This is the resume of my work as student in Bootcamp Backend (Java & Spring Framework) by IT Academy (Barcelona Activa). 
The bootcamp was split in 5 Sprints where I learned:

### [ üìÇ Sprint 1: Consolidating the Java language](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1)
From the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP), such as inheritance and polymorphism, to advanced features such as collections, annotations, testing and lambda expressions.

+ **[1. Inheritance and Polymorphism:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2001%20Her%C3%A8ncia%20i%20Polimorfism)** Fundamental OOP Principles.
+ **[2.Exceptions:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2002%20Exceptions)** Learn how to handle Exceptions to build robust code.
+ **[3.Java Collections:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2003%20Java%20Collections)** Data structures in Java. To become familiar with the handling of Java Collections to know how to use them in subsequent implementations.
+ **[4.Testing libraries:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2004%20Testing)** Learn to work with the JUnit, Hamcrest and AssertJ aseserts libraries.
+ **[5.Java utils:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2005%20Java%20Utils)** Handling of files, paths and console commands.
+ **[6.Generics:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2006%20Generics)** Learn how to handle abstractions with Generics.
+ **[7.Annotations:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2007%20Annotations)** To know how annotations work in Java.
+ **[8.Lambdas:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/SPRINT1/Tasca%20S1%2008%20Lambdas)** To learn how to handle functional programming with lambdas.

üë©‚Äçüè´ **Addicional:** [Presentation Masterclass Exceptions:](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-1/tree/main/Masterclass%20Exception) Presentation made in the classroom for the rest of the students of IT Academy as an introduction to the Exceptions.
  
### [ üìÇ Sprint 2: Database development](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-2)

Designing, modeling and querying relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.

+ **[1. Data structure - MySQL](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-2/tree/main/SPRINT%202/Tasca%20S2%2001%20%20Estructura%20de%20dades%20-%20MySQL)** Learn how to model SQL databases.
+ **[2. MySQL queries](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-2/tree/main/SPRINT%202/Tasca%20S2%2002%20MySQL%20queries)** Learning to query a SQL database.
+ **[3. Data structure - MongoDB](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-2/tree/main/SPRINT%202/Tasca%20S2%2003%20%20Estructura%20de%20dades%20-%20MongoDB)** Learn how to model NoSQL databases.
+ **[4. MongoDB queries](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-2/tree/main/SPRINT%202/Tasca%20S2%2004%20MongoDB%20queries)** Learn how to query a NoSQL database.

### [ üìÇ Sprint 3: Patterns](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-3)

Design software through advanced structures, which are always established on the basis of patterns, also start working as a team, integrating your developments into collaborative platforms.

+ **[1. Patterns 1](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-3/blob/master/src/main/java/SPRINT%203/Tasca%20S3%2001%20Patterns%201/README.md)** Apply the Singelton, Abstract Factory and Command patterns.
+ **[2. Patterns 2](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-3/tree/master/src/main/java/SPRINT%203/Tasca%20S3%2002%20Patterns%202)** Apply the Builder, Observer and Callback patterns.
+ **[3. Developers Team](https://github.com/ariamdev/ITACADEMY_SCAPE_ROOM)** Project to work in a team of 3 people, learning Git Flow, applying patterns and also Database (CRUD).

### [ üìÇ Sprint 4: Spring Boot](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-4)

Know the basic structure of a Spring Boot project. We will delve into the HTTP protocol, HTTP requests with Postman and Microservices such as annotations, layer separation, quick configuration, etc.

+ [**1. Introduction to Spring:**](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-4/tree/main/Tasca%20S4.01%20Introducci%C3%B3%20a%20Spring)  Introduction to the SPRING framework. We will use the HTTP protocol, Postman, and dependencies will be managed with Maven and Gradle.
+ [**2. Api Rest with Spring boot:**](https://github.com/ariamdev/IT-ACADEMY-SPRINT-4/tree/main/Tasca%20S4.02%20Api%20Rest%20amb%20Spring%20boot) We will perform a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with 3 different databases: H2, MySQL and MongoDB. We will also use HTTP Verbs, HTTP Headers and HTTP Status Codes to manage response codes.
